        A <b>web crawler</b>, also know as a "spider",
        is a small piece of program that automatically browses web pages and sends the URL of such web pages back to the system;
        it is also able to follow links in a web page to another and repeat the same procedure.

        <b>Web crawlers</b> start working from a list of given web URLs or the previous crawling result.
        They read though a web page just like we do, except they are much faster and pay more attention.
        They then send back the URL and follow all possible links in a web page, whether it is a picture or text link.
        The <b>crawling</b> process is completed when <b>crawlers</b> cannot reach any new web pages.

        Think the Internet as a gigantic room with hundreds of thousands of bookshelves; and every web page is a book.
        Today, books are spread across the whole room without any pattern.
        We certainly can not search for a particular book or book of the same topic in such a circumstance. Thus, this is where <b>crawling</b> takes place.
        In this gigantic room example, <b>crawling</b> is the process of finding the location of as many books as we can.
        The URL that a crawler sends back is the location of a book.
        The search engine's system will temporarily store all location and then go over them one by one, which is the <b>indexing</b> process.
