        A <b>search engine index</b> is essentially a database or a set of databases that a search engine uses to store referential and descriptive data of web pages.
        It works like a library index as both of them are designed to help people finding information faster and easier.
        Like books being classified into different categories in a library, web pages will be stored in the <b>index</b> with some classification.

        <b>Indexing</b> is a process where a search engine read though web pages from crawling and save necessary information to the search engine's <b>index</b>.
        Type of information being saved varies for different search engines.
        Most well known search engines will save a copy of a entire web page and use some keyword tags to describe such a web page in the <b>index</b>,
        while some small scale search engines may only save the title of a web page.

        In the gigantic room example discussed earlier, indexing is like to make some categorized lists of the topic and location of books.
        The combination of such lists is equivalent to an index.
