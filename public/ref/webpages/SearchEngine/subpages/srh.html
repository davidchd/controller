        When a user searches for something in a search engine, search engine's system extracts keywords from the sentence or phrase that the user searches for.
        The system will then loop up for extracted keywords in its index.
        <br />

        However, extracting keywords from a query can be relatively very difficult, especially for a computer rather than a person.
        In our natural language, one single word can stand for different meanings in different circumstances.
        At the right side is an example that shows how the word "change" stands for three different meanings in different context.
        Many search engine companies spend millions of dollars every year to develop and optimize algorithms
        in order to enable a computer system to better understand our language.

        The result of a search will be displayed as a sort of list, which, obviously, has an order.
        It is certainly not just random pattern but some particular ranks.
        <b>Ranking</b> in a search engine is like to put book into a library index in sequence.
        Differ from a library, which usually sorts books by an order such as alphabetical or numerical,
        the way a search engine ranks web pages are far more complicated than just alphabetical or numerical order.
        When <b>raking</b> a web page, a search engine takes a variety of factors into consideration such as number of access and commercial value.
        After matched results of a user's query has been found, result with a higher <b>rank</b> will be display at top, followed by those with lower <b>ranks</b>.

        Eventually, when an user searches for a query in a search engine, the search engine will extracting keywords from the query,
        look up for matched result in its index, return results from crawling, and display results according to their ranks.
        After all these steps in the backend of a search engine, one time of search has been solved.
