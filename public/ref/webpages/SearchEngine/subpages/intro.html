        A <b>search engine</b> is a web-based system that enable users to search for specific information across the internet.
        A <b>search engine</b> differs from a web directory, which is updated and maintained by humans;
        <b>search engines</b> usually use a small piece of software to loop up for new information real-time and automatically.
        With a query given by a user, a <b>search engine</b> will look for relevant information in its database and show the result to the user in certain patterns.
        It is to say, the most core part of a <b>search engine</b> might be its database and the patterns it shows the result.
        The approach that a search engine builds and updates its database includes two parts: <b>crawl</b> and <b>index</b>;
        and the patterns for a search engine to display the result is based on web pages' <b>rank</b>.
